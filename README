Here's a docker build that _should_ be a little more stable than the standard method
of building op25. Use docker-compose to build and run. It's Linux only as MacOS doesn't
include the same capabilities to supply access to USB devices to containers.

See run.sh for an example for how to run. You'll need to supply your own trunk.tsv and
talkgroups tsv, of course.  You can follow the instructions on this page for doing so:

By default in the compose file, /dev/snd is provided to the container, so you can get
audio out of it. I haven't quite figured out how to get the audio into pulseaudio
(for easy streaming with OBS etc), but pacat may be an option for that with the UDP
audio option from rx.py, which is the default entrypoint for this image.
