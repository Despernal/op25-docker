Do you have an RTL-SDR dongle and want to do P25 scanning, but you're running a newer operating system that no longer provides gnuradio 3.8? This solution uses docker to provide a working instance of op25.

Configure:
modify config/trunk.tsv and add your own tagfile
modify rx.sh as needed:
    For example, for a text console in the docker container, change --terminal-type=curses and change -d to -it

Build:
docker build -t op25-docker .

Run:
./run.sh

See run.sh for an example for how to run. You'll need to supply your own trunk.tsv and
talkgroups tsv, of course.  You can follow the instructions on this page for doing so:

Connecting audio:
Requires pulseaudio on the host system until I figure out UDP/streaming.

GUI:
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8765
