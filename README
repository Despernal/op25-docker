This is a docker build that is adapted from lysol/op25-docker

It uses debian:bullseye and the boatbod build of op25

Build:
docker-compose build

Run:
./run.sh

See run.sh for an example for how to run. You'll need to supply your own trunk.tsv and
talkgroups tsv, of course.  You can follow the instructions on this page for doing so:

GUI:
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8765

Using rx.py vs multi_rx.py:
