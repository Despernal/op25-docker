This is a docker build that is adapted from lysol/op25-docker

It uses debian:bullseye instead of ubuntu:18.04 because ubuntu is bloat,
and the boatbod build of op25 instead of osmocom, because boatbod is somewhat actively developed.
But, we don't use the boatbod install.sh because it sucks, we already install the prereqs and know
we're using gnuradio 3.8.

See run.sh for an example for how to run. You'll need to supply your own trunk.tsv and
talkgroups tsv, of course.  You can follow the instructions on this page for doing so:

By default in the compose file, /dev/snd is provided to the container, so you can get
audio out of it. I haven't quite figured out how to get the audio into pulseaudio
(for easy streaming with OBS etc), but pacat may be an option for that with the UDP
audio option from rx.py, which is the default entrypoint for this image.
