This is a docker build that is adapted from lysol/op25-docker

It uses debian:bullseye and the boatbod build of op25

Configure:
modify config/trunk.tsv and add your own tagfile
modify rx.sh as needed:
    To use a curses console in the docker container, change --terminal-type=curses
    To run headless, change -it to -d

Build:
docker build -t op25-docker .

Run:
./run.sh

See run.sh for an example for how to run. You'll need to supply your own trunk.tsv and
talkgroups tsv, of course.  You can follow the instructions on this page for doing so:

Connecting audio:
Requires pulseaudio on the host system until I figure out UDP/streaming.

GUI:
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8765
